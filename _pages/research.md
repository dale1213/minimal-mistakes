## Research Experiences

**Columbia University — Task decomposition for agents**  
Research Assistant, DAP Lab; Supervisors: Prof. Eugene Wu  
Sep 2024 – Current · New York  
- Developed a constraint graph modeling approach to capture complex state dependencies (e.g., structured queries), enabling principled reasoning for LLM-based agents.  
- Applied reduction theory and constraint process techniques to formalize boundaries between solvable vs. intractable dependency problems.  
- Deployed the algorithm to text-to-SQL tasks (SPIDER benchmark), achieving significant improvements (~40% enhancement) over baseline LLM agents.

**Columbia University — System for agents**  
Research Assistant, DAP Lab; Supervisors: Prof. Eugene Wu, Prof. Kostis Kaffes  
Sep 2024 – Current · New York  
- Designed a system-native exploration framework for LLM agents using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), adapting reinforcement learning techniques to system-level automation tasks.  
- Benchmarked and optimized snapshotting and restoration pipelines (container checkpointing, state restoration), reducing exploration rollout time by an average of 60% under constrained resources.  
- Conducted experiments on coding and file-management tasks, showing exploration improves success rates vs. single-shot prompting.

**City University of Hong Kong — Research Assistant**  
Global ESG Analytical Lab; Supervisor: Prof. Rengong Zhang  
Dec 2023 – Feb 2024  
- Engineered a research-level ESG data disclosure platform with Azure deployment.  
- Employed Vue and FastAPI across front-end and back-end to boost iteration speed and responsiveness.  
- Optimized data visualization with ECharts for dynamic interactions.  
- Utilized ontology mapping to boost ESG research with NLP (Sentence Transformer with BERT).  
- Built an end-to-end pipeline for data augmentation integrating HNSW for efficient ANN search.
